  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "pybind11"
  (requested version 2.6) with any of the following names:

    pybind11Config.cmake
    pybind11-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "pybind11" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "pybind11_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "pybind11" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
